We lean into both cultural identities: Swiss privacy and British prestige hospitality. Our product combines highly-trained chauffeurs, fine in-car experiences, and instant journey availability via a well-designed app.Over the next 5-10 years we plan to build out and offer a full portfolio of luxury personal services, allowing clients to protect their time beyond just chauffeuring. Wheely operates in some of the world's largest cities, including London, Paris, and Dubai. We are a Series B scale-up, and have raised $28 million to date.WheelyWheely is on a mission to build the LVMH for luxury services, beginning with a trusted white glove chauffeur and assistant service. Data, Science and Technology are central to achieving this mission, ensuring appropriate gating and pricing on the consumer demand side, as well as understanding, reducing and optimising for barriers to entry on the labour market supply side.Discretion is one of Wheely's core values — where people travel, and who they travel with, is at their discretion. We respect their private life and their actions. Wheely has in the past refused to hand over requests to share passenger/journey data to governments, and we will continue to honour our commitment. This has led us to start developing technology in 2020 to put our clients' movements beyond our own reach.MarketplaceThe Marketplace team is responsible for matching passenger requests with available chauffeurs. Their areas of responsibility are pricing, dispatching/matching protocols and incentives. Their success criteria are to maximise welfare (i.e. reliability, utilisation) and to avoid a known failure mode of ride-hailing marketplaces known as the wild goose chase.Scientists in the MarketplaceWhile there are existing capabilities, including an app with heuristic dispatch capabilities, that have aided with our success so far we now need to deepen our understanding of our marketplace and embed prediction & optimisation throughout it. We're looking for a talented Data Scientist to join to define metrics, produce insights & predictive models and ultimately introduce practices from empirical science as needed to achieve our future ambitions.This is a unique opportunity for talented, commercially and user oriented scientists to develop core marketplace capabilities in a mature and profitable company with a unique customer base and take on ride hailing.Strong preference will be given to those who have 2+ years experience in a similar role at another ride hailing company.What you'll do in the next 12 monthsDefine and make readily available the Wheely Marketplace metrics: Work with the Data Analysts and leadership in the Marketplace team to establish holistic metric frameworks to measure performance of initiatives from all perspectives in the marketplace (e.g. Chauffeurs, passengers and Wheely). Develop the internal self-service reporting capability for the marketplace team and Wheely leadership to track the metrics on a daily basis (e.g. batch hourly, daily but not real-time). Produce insights and make recommendations: Segment the driver allocation and dispatch problems (e.g. Airport, rural, urban rush hour, festival days etc), establish baseline performance and work with the Marketplace team to propose 3 hypotheses to improve marketplace performance across the segments. Establish prediction problems and develop offline models: For example, build a trip demand forecast as an input to daily driver dispatch by area and work with product teams to develop features and incentives as needed to implement it within next 3-6 months (e.g. notifications along with x pounds to drive in this area this week). Work cross functionally to ensure scientific control in marketplace metrics: Bring your insights, models and capabilities to the Marketplace team to ensure we can make controlled improvements in any marketplace metric metric through controlled changes in other metrics (e.g. to increase utilisation by X, we increase price by Y). Work with Marketplace engineers to ensure we have a platform that enables us to develop insights and implement the predictive models as needed to power and continuously improve our Marketplace performance overtime. Help pave the way for more scientists. Identify gaps in Science capability based on the challenges you're facing and your past experience (e.g. economists, data scientists, user researchers, operations researchers, ML engineers, etc). Work with your line manager to create a case for hiring those capabilities. Own your role and create your own path: Connect with the team, understand the company goals (e.g. OKRs) and your role; Align with your line manager and team about how you will contribute and any critical dependencies you'll have. Based on what you've learned about Wheely and your understanding of the domain, propose 1 new OKR and/or 2-3 features/projects that ensure the impact of Science on Marketplace objectives in 2023.

Factories, power plants, buildings, etc. operate the same they've operated for decades — because the controls programming is hard-coded. Thousands of lines of rules and heuristics that define how the machines interact with each other. The result of all this hard-coding is that facilities are frozen in time, unable to adapt to their environment while their performance slowly degrades.Phaidra creates AI-powered control systems for the industrial sector, enabling industrial facilities to automatically learn and improve over time. Specifically:We use reinforcement learning algorithms to provide this intelligence, converting raw sensor data into high-value actions and decisions. We focus on industrial applications, which tend to be well-sensorized with measurable KPIs — perfect for reinforcement learning. We enable domain experts (our users) to configure the AI control systems (i.e. agents) without writing code. They define what they want their AI agents to do, and we do it for them. Our team has a track record of applying AI to some of the toughest problems. From achieving superhuman performance with DeepMind's AlphaGo, to reducing the energy required to cool Google's Data Centers by 40%, we deeply understand AI and how to apply it in production for massive impact.Phaidra is based in the USA but 100% remote; we do not have a physical office.
